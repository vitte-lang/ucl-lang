UCL — Universal Configuration Language

UCL (Universal Configuration Language) is a modern, human-readable and extensible configuration language designed to replace JSON, YAML, and TOML in a unified way.

It is built to be:
	•	Simple to read and write
	•	Easy to parse and implement
	•	Powerful enough for complex systems
	•	Suitable for any type of project (OS, backend, cloud, tools)

  Features
	•	Clean and minimal syntax
	•	Structured configuration (sections & nested keys)
	•	Strong readability (no YAML pitfalls)
	•	Expressions support (+, -, *, /)
	•	Environment variables (env("KEY"))
	•	References ($var)
	•	Profiles (dev, prod, test)
	•	Modules / plugins / services
	•	Schema validation
	•	Macros & templates
	•	Merge & override system

UCL can be used for:
	•	Operating systems configuration (e.g. VitteOS)
	•	Backend services
	•	DevOps / cloud infrastructure
	•	CLI tools
	•	Application settings
	•	Embedded systems

⸻

 Implementation Goals
	•	Lightweight parser
	•	Zero ambiguity syntax
	•	Fast evaluation
	•	Easy embedding in any language
	•	Minimal dependencies
